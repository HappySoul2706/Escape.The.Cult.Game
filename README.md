Prologue:
You wake up dazed and confused, nothing makes sense, you were once in a far off place warm and happy now you’ve awoken in a cold wet prison. 
As you explore an abandoned base it becomes apparent everyone there left in a hurry, furniture overturned doors locked. And those who couldn't
make it out, made their own way out clearly now wanting to face whatever made them leave. You can't shake the feeling you’ve been here before,
one of them even reminds you of who you were. How did you get there? Why can't you remember? Why were you in a cold wet dungeon? Even if you
can't answer these questions you know you must Escape!
